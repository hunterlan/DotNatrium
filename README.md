## Task

The chemical laboratory needs a database for the chemical reactions.
The database should contain:
- information about chemical elements, their name, symbol, description, and the amount available in the laboratory.
- information about compounds, their name, symbol, description and available amount

Compounds consist of different chemical elements.
The chemical laboratory should be able to save records about any chemical reaction. Reaction record should contain the name, components used in it (chemical elements or/and compounds), the amount of those components, date of reaction, and created products (compounds or/and chemical elements).
In each reaction can be used one or more components. The same with products.
